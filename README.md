This project illustrates a few basic macOS concepts.

- Document-based app
- Loading and saving to a simple JSON file using JSONSerialization
- Setting up simple view-based NSTableView
- Handling delete key to remove selected item in a table view
- TODO: handling undo/redo stack using NSUndoManager
